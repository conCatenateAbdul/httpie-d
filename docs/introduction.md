# HTTPie Documentation

**HTTPie** (pronounced *aych-tee-tee-pie*) is a command-line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple `http` command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple, natural syntax, and displays colorized output.



## Why HTTPie?
* **Expressive:** Simple syntax for headers, JSON, and files.
* **Built-in JSON support:** No need to install `jq` for basic formatting.
* **Persistent Sessions:** Log in once, stay logged in.
* **Extensions:** A plugin system to support custom auth and more.

## Getting Started quickly

If you are new here, start with the **[Installation](./getting-started/installation)** guide.

If you are a veteran looking for flags, jump to the **[Command Line Options](./reference/command-line-options)** reference.

## Interactive Guide structure
This documentation is organized into three sections:

1.  **Getting Started:** Zero to Hero in 10 minutes.
2.  **Guides:** Deep dives into Authentication, Uploads, and Scripting.
3.  **Reference:** Cheat sheets for flags and variables.

Let's make APIs fun again! 🚀
